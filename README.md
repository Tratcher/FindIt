# FindIt
A location aware, crowd sourced shopping list.

#### Inspiration:
Costco doesn't have any maps that I can find, doesn't lable it's aisles, and it's huge.

#### Challenge:
How do I build a map of all the things? In all the stores? And keep it updated?

#### Idea: GPS aware shopping list
- Whenever I check off a new thing on my list, record that GPS location. Next time I'm looking for the same thing, show me where I found it in the past.
- Crowd source: It would take me  while to build up a useful dataset for all of Costco, not to mention both Costcos and the other grocery stores. The information is rarely sensitive, why not just share it? Everyone can benefit from everyone else's experience. Stores could even participate my mimicking normal user actions.
- This isn't grocery store specific, it's good for just about any task in public spaces.
  - Groceries
  - Retail
  - ATMs
  - Meals/restaurants
  - Services - Haircut
  - Errands
  - Gas
